#### __Reflections and Comments__

Today I tried to rely on my class notes as little as possible, only referencing them when I was stuck. It made for alot of googling but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I had retained. <br> 
I need to work on my logic. I have a general idea of what I want to accomplish and can get most of the way there but I need to work on best practices.

#### __Reflections and Comments__

This was a stress free day of css and chart.js. I enjoyed practicing flexbox, and looking forward to working on grid. Char.js was fairly straight forward to install and use.

Pretty easy day of formulaic work. KNowing where i want to grab data to send to the local storage is going to take some thinking though. If you are reading this download Grepper, very useful little plugin for chrome
